The Carbon Emission for "Inner Mongolia Information Park" is 0 because China has moved into reduction of CO2. This is to ensure eco friendly environment. Since this data centre is being built, it plans on reducing all emissions.

Inner Mongolia Information Park Data Centre is located in Inner Mongolia, China. It is owned by China Telecom. This is the largest data centre in Hohhot, the capital of Inner Mongolia. 

It was established in 2016. "In 2016, the region designated the big data and cloud computing industries as new engines for local development, vowing that the regional big data industry's output value will exceed 100 billion yuan (14.5 billion U. S. dollars) in 2020." [1] 

The IT Load is 150MW = 150 * 1000 = 150,000kW. The data centre is operated for 24 hours. So, the electricity cost would be 150,000 * 24 = $241,200,000. The yearly cost projected is around $14.5billion+ by 2020. [5]

Since the yearly CO2 footprint is being minimized every year, it is hard to estimate the exact figure but it is nearly 6 tons. [2] [3]

"China’s hyperscale data center industry is the second largest in the world, comprising 8% of the global
market. Researchers estimate that in 2018 China was home to 1.2 million server racks from large and ultralarge scale data centers and 1.5 million server racks from small and mid-scale data centers. China’s data center industry consumed 161 TWh of
electricity in 2018.35% of the country’s total electricity consumption. Researchers found that electricity consumption from the industry is on track to increase by 66% in the next five years, reaching 267 TWh by 2023, more than Australia’s total 2018 electricity consumption. In a typical data center in China, 80% of electricity is consumed by servers and cooling equipment." [4]

Renewable Energy and impact of country's dynamics on the environment have been major factors for China over the past decade. Several initiatives have been taken to ensure that China is technology driven in eco friendly ways. But, electricity is one thing that was not paid much attention to. Now, significant efforts have been taken at data centres to ensure that there is cost cutting even in the electricity sector.
